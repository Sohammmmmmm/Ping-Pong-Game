# Ping-Pong-Game
Ping pong, or table tennis, is a fast-paced sport where players hit a lightweight ball across a table using paddles. The goal is to score points by making the ball land on the opponent's side so they can't return it. Played in singles or doubles, it requires quick reflexes, precision, and strategy.
